# Tests

 - [ ] `*` Returns the product of nums. (*) returns 1. Does not auto-promote longs, will throw on overflow. See also: *'
 - [ ] `*'` Returns the product of nums. (*') returns 1. Supports arbitrary precision. See also: *
 - [ ] `*1` bound in a repl thread to the most recent value printed
 - [ ] `*2` bound in a repl thread to the second most recent value printed
 - [ ] `*3` bound in a repl thread to the third most recent value printed
 - [ ] `*agent*` The agent currently running an action on this thread, else nil
 - [ ] `*allow-unresolved-vars*` no doc
 - [ ] `*assert*` no doc
 - [ ] `*clojure-version*` The version info for Clojure core, as a map containing :major :minor :incremental and :qualifier keys. Feature releases may increment :minor and/or :major, bugfix releases will increment :incremental. Possible values of :qualifier include "GA", "SNAPSHOT", "RC-x" "BETA-x"
 - [ ] `*command-line-args*` A sequence of the supplied command line arguments, or nil if none were supplied
 - [ ] `*compile-files*` Set to true when compiling files, false otherwise.
 - [ ] `*compile-path*` Specifies the directory where 'compile' will write out .class files. This directory must be in the classpath for 'compile' to work. Defaults to "classes"
 - [ ] `*compiler-options*` A map of keys to options. Note, when binding dynamically make sure to merge with previous value. Supported options: :elide-meta - a collection of metadata keys to elide during compilation. :disable-locals-clearing - set to true to disable clearing, useful for using a debugger :direct-linking - set to true to use direct static invocation of functions, rather than vars Note that call sites compiled with direct linking will not be affected by var redefinition. Use ^:redef (or ^:dynamic) on a var to prevent direct linking and allow redefinition. See https://clojure.org/reference/compilation for more information.
 - [ ] `*data-readers*` Map from reader tag symbols to data reader Vars. When Clojure starts, it searches for files named 'data_readers.clj' and 'data_readers.cljc' at the root of the classpath. Each such file must contain a literal map of symbols, like this: {foo/bar my.project.foo/bar foo/baz my.project/baz} The first symbol in each pair is a tag that will be recognized by the Clojure reader. The second symbol in the pair is the fully-qualified name of a Var which will be invoked by the reader to parse the form following the tag. For example, given the data_readers.clj file above, the Clojure reader would parse this form: #foo/bar [1 2 3] by invoking the Var #'my.project.foo/bar on the vector [1 2 3]. The data reader function is invoked on the form AFTER it has been read as a normal Clojure data structure by the reader. Reader tags without namespace qualifiers are reserved for Clojure. Default reader tags are defined in clojure.core/default-data-readers but may be overridden in data_readers.clj, data_readers.cljc, or by rebinding this Var.
 - [ ] `*default-data-reader-fn*` When no data reader is found for a tag and *default-data-reader-fn* is non-nil, it will be called with two arguments, the tag and the value. If *default-data-reader-fn* is nil (the default), an exception will be thrown for the unknown tag.
 - [ ] `*e` bound in a repl thread to the most recent exception caught by the repl
 - [ ] `*err*` A java.io.Writer object representing standard error for print operations. Defaults to System/err, wrapped in a PrintWriter
 - [ ] `*file*` The path of the file being evaluated, as a String. When there is no file, e.g. in the REPL, the value is not defined.
 - [ ] `*flush-on-newline*` When set to true, output will be flushed whenever a newline is printed. Defaults to true.
 - [ ] `*fn-loader*` no doc
 - [ ] `*in*` A java.io.Reader object representing standard input for read operations. Defaults to System/in, wrapped in a LineNumberingPushbackReader
 - [ ] `*math-context*` no doc
 - [ ] `*ns*` A clojure.lang.Namespace object representing the current namespace.
 - [ ] `*out*` A java.io.Writer object representing standard output for print operations. Defaults to System/out, wrapped in an OutputStreamWriter
 - [ ] `*print-dup*` When set to logical true, objects will be printed in a way that preserves their type when read in later. Defaults to false.
 - [ ] `*print-length*` *print-length* controls how many items of each collection the printer will print. If it is bound to logical false, there is no limit. Otherwise, it must be bound to an integer indicating the maximum number of items of each collection to print. If a collection contains more items, the printer will print items up to the limit followed by '...' to represent the remaining items. The root binding is nil indicating no limit.
 - [ ] `*print-level*` *print-level* controls how many levels deep the printer will print nested objects. If it is bound to logical false, there is no limit. Otherwise, it must be bound to an integer indicating the maximum level to print. Each argument to print is at level 0; if an argument is a collection, its items are at level 1; and so on. If an object is a collection and is at a level greater than or equal to the value bound to *print-level*, the printer prints '#' to represent it. The root binding is nil indicating no limit.
 - [ ] `*print-meta*` If set to logical true, when printing an object, its metadata will also be printed in a form that can be read back by the reader. Defaults to false.
 - [ ] `*print-namespace-maps*` *print-namespace-maps* controls whether the printer will print namespace map literal syntax. It defaults to false, but the REPL binds to true.
 - [ ] `*print-readably*` When set to logical false, strings and characters will be printed with non-alphanumeric characters converted to the appropriate escape sequences. Defaults to true
 - [ ] `*read-eval*` Defaults to true (or value specified by system property, see below) ***This setting implies that the full power of the reader is in play, including syntax that can cause code to execute. It should never be used with untrusted sources. See also: clojure.edn/read.*** When set to logical false in the thread-local binding, the eval reader (#=) and record/type literal syntax are disabled in read/load. Example (will fail): (binding [*read-eval* false] (read-string "#=(* 2 21)")) The default binding can be controlled by the system property 'clojure.read.eval' System properties can be set on the command line like this: java -Dclojure.read.eval=false ... The system property can also be set to 'unknown' via -Dclojure.read.eval=unknown, in which case the default binding is :unknown and all reads will fail in contexts where *read-eval* has not been explicitly bound to either true or false. This setting can be a useful diagnostic tool to ensure that all of your reads occur in considered contexts. You can also accomplish this in a particular scope by binding *read-eval* to :unknown
 - [ ] `*reader-resolver*` no doc
 - [ ] `*source-path*` no doc
 - [ ] `*suppress-read*` no doc
 - [ ] `*unchecked-math*` While bound to true, compilations of +, -, *, inc, dec and the coercions will be done without overflow checks. While bound to :warn-on-boxed, same behavior as true, and a warning is emitted when compilation uses boxed math. Default: false.
 - [ ] `*use-context-classloader*` no doc
 - [ ] `*verbose-defrecords*` no doc
 - [ ] `*warn-on-reflection*` When set to true, the compiler will emit warnings when reflection is needed to resolve Java method calls or field accesses. Defaults to false.

 - [ ] `-'` If no ys are supplied, returns the negation of x, else subtracts the ys from x and returns the result. Supports arbitrary precision. See also: -
 - [ ] `->` Threads the expr through the forms. Inserts x as the second item in the first form, making a list of it if it is not a list already. If there are more forms, inserts the first form as the second item in second form, etc.
 - [ ] `->>` Threads the expr through the forms. Inserts x as the last item in the first form, making a list of it if it is not a list already. If there are more forms, inserts the first form as the last item in second form, etc.

 - [ ] `.`  The '.' special form is the basis for access to Java. It can be considered a member-access operator, and/or read as 'in the scope of'. See http://clojure.org/special_forms for more information.
 - [ ] `..`  form => fieldName-symbol or (instanceMethodName-symbol args*) Expands into a member access (.) of the first member on the first argument, followed by the next member on the result, etc. For instance: (.. System (getProperties) (get "os.name")) expands to: (. (. System (getProperties)) (get "os.name")) but is easier to write, read, and understand.
 - [ ] `/` If no denominators are supplied, returns 1/numerator, else returns numerator divided by all of the denominators.
 - [ ] `<` Returns non-nil if nums are in monotonically increasing order, otherwise false.
 - [ ] `<=` Returns non-nil if nums are in monotonically non-decreasing order, otherwise false.
 - [ ] `=` Equality. Returns true if x equals y, false if not. Same as Java x.equals(y) except it also works for nil, and compares numbers and collections in a type-independent manner. Clojure's immutable data structures define equals() (and thus =) as a value, not an identity, comparison.
 - [ ] `==` Returns non-nil if nums all have the equivalent value (type-independent), otherwise false
 - [ ] `>` Returns non-nil if nums are in monotonically decreasing order, otherwise false.
 - [ ] `>=` Returns non-nil if nums are in monotonically non-increasing order, otherwise false.
 - [x] ~`abs` Returns the absolute value of a. If a is Long/MIN_VALUE => Long/MIN_VALUE If a is a double and zero => +0.0 If a is a double and ##Inf or ##-Inf => ##Inf If a is a double and ##NaN => ##NaN~
 - [ ] `accessor` Returns a fn that, given an instance of a structmap with the basis, returns the value at the key. The key must be in the basis. The returned function should be (slightly) more efficient than using get, but such use of accessors should be limited to known performance-critical areas.
 - [ ] `aclone` Returns a clone of the Java array. Works on arrays of known types.
 - [ ] `add-classpath` DEPRECATED Adds the url (String or URL object) to the classpath per URLClassLoader.addURL
 - [ ] `add-tap` adds f, a fn of one argument, to the tap set. This function will be called with anything sent via tap>. This function may (briefly) block (e.g. for streams), and will never impede calls to tap>, but blocking indefinitely may cause tap values to be dropped. Remember f in order to remove-tap
 - [ ] `add-watch` Adds a watch function to an agent/atom/var/ref reference. The watch fn must be a fn of 4 args: a key, the reference, its old-state, its new-state. Whenever the reference's state might have been changed, any registered watches will have their functions called. The watch fn will be called synchronously, on the agent's thread if an agent, before any pending sends if agent or ref. Note that an atom's or ref's state may have changed again prior to the fn call, so use old/new-state rather than derefing the reference. Note also that watch fns may be called from multiple threads simultaneously. Var watchers are triggered only by root binding changes, not thread-local set!s. Keys must be unique per reference, and can be used to remove the watch with remove-watch, but are otherwise considered opaque by the watch mechanism.
 - [ ] `agent` Creates and returns an agent with an initial value of state and zero or more options (in any order): :meta metadata-map :validator validate-fn :error-handler handler-fn :error-mode mode-keyword If metadata-map is supplied, it will become the metadata on the agent. validate-fn must be nil or a side-effect-free fn of one argument, which will be passed the intended new state on any state change. If the new state is unacceptable, the validate-fn should return false or throw an exception. handler-fn is called if an action throws an exception or if validate-fn rejects a new state -- see set-error-handler! for details. The mode-keyword may be either :continue (the default if an error-handler is given) or :fail (the default if no error-handler is given) -- see set-error-mode! for details.
 - [ ] `agent-error` Returns the exception thrown during an asynchronous action of the agent if the agent is failed. Returns nil if the agent is not failed.
 - [ ] `agent-errors` DEPRECATED: Use 'agent-error' instead. Returns a sequence of the exceptions thrown during asynchronous actions of the agent.

 - [ ] `alength` Returns the length of the Java array. Works on arrays of all types.
 - [ ] `alias` Add an alias in the current namespace to another namespace. Arguments are two symbols: the alias to be used, and the symbolic name of the target namespace. Use :as in the ns macro in preference to calling this directly.
 - [ ] `all-ns` Returns a sequence of all namespaces.
 - [ ] `alter` Must be called in a transaction. Sets the in-transaction-value of ref to: (apply fun in-transaction-value-of-ref args) and returns the in-transaction-value of ref.

 - [ ] `ancestors` Returns the immediate and indirect parents of tag, either via a Java type inheritance relationship or a relationship established via derive. h must be a hierarchy obtained from make-hierarchy, if not supplied defaults to the global hierarchy
 - [x] `and` Evaluates exprs one at a time, from left to right. If a form returns logical false (nil or false), and returns that value and doesn't evaluate any of the other expressions, otherwise it returns the value of the last expr. (and) returns true.
 - [x] `any?`  Returns true given any argument.
 - [ ] `apply` Applies fn f to the argument list formed by prepending intervening arguments to args.
 - [ ] `areduce` Reduces an expression across an array a, using an index named idx, and return value named ret, initialized to init, setting ret to the evaluation of expr at each step, returning ret.
 - [ ] `array-map` Constructs an array-map. If any keys are equal, they are handled as if by repeated uses of assoc.

 - [ ] `assoc!`  When applied to a transient map, adds mapping of key(s) to val(s). When applied to a transient vector, sets the val at index. Note - index must be <= (count vector). Returns coll.
 - [ ] `assoc-in` Associates a value in a nested associative structure, where ks is a sequence of keys and v is the new value and returns a new nested structure. If any levels do not exist, hash-maps will be created.
 - [ ] `associative?`  Returns true if coll implements Associative
 - [ ] `atom` Creates and returns an Atom with an initial value of x and zero or more options (in any order): :meta metadata-map :validator validate-fn If metadata-map is supplied, it will become the metadata on the atom. validate-fn must be nil or a side-effect-free fn of one argument, which will be passed the intended new state on any state change. If the new state is unacceptable, the validate-fn should return false or throw an exception.
 - [ ] `await` Blocks the current thread (indefinitely!) until all actions dispatched thus far, from this thread or agent, to the agent(s) have occurred. Will block on failed agents. Will never return if a failed agent is restarted with :clear-actions true or shutdown-agents was called.
 - [ ] `await-for` Blocks the current thread until all actions dispatched thus far (from this thread or agent) to the agents have occurred, or the timeout (in milliseconds) has elapsed. Returns logical false if returning due to timeout, logical true otherwise.

 - [ ] `binding` binding => var-symbol init-expr Creates new bindings for the (already-existing) vars, with the supplied initial values, executes the exprs in an implicit do, then re-establishes the bindings that existed before. The new bindings are made in parallel (unlike let); all init-exprs are evaluated before the vars are bound to their new values.
 - [x] `bit-and` Bitwise and
 - [x] `bit-and-not` Bitwise and with complement
 - [x] `bit-clear` Clear bit at index n

 - [ ] `boolean` Coerce to boolean
 - [ ] `boolean-array` Creates an array of booleans
 - [ ] `boolean?`  Return true if x is a Boolean
 - [ ] `booleans` Casts to boolean[]
 - [ ] `bound-fn` Returns a function defined by the given fntail, which will install the same bindings in effect as in the thread at the time bound-fn was called. This may be used to define a helper function which runs on a different thread, but needs the same bindings in place.
 - [ ] `bound-fn*` Returns a function, which will install the same bindings in effect as in the thread at the time bound-fn* was called and then call f with any given arguments. This may be used to define a helper function which runs on a different thread, but needs the same bindings in place.
 - [ ] `bound?`  Returns true if all of the vars provided as arguments have any bound value, root or thread-local. Implies that deref'ing the provided vars will succeed. Returns true if no vars are provided.
 - [ ] `bounded-count` If coll is counted? returns its count, else will count at most the first n elements of coll using its seq
 - [ ] `butlast` Return a seq of all but the last item in coll, in linear time
 - [ ] `byte` Coerce to byte
 - [ ] `byte-array` Creates an array of bytes
 - [ ] `bytes` Casts to bytes[]
 - [ ] `bytes?`  Return true if x is a byte array
 - [ ] `case` Takes an expression, and a set of clauses. Each clause can take the form of either: test-constant result-expr (test-constant1 ... test-constantN) result-expr The test-constants are not evaluated. They must be compile-time literals, and need not be quoted. If the expression is equal to a test-constant, the corresponding result-expr is returned. A single default expression can follow the clauses, and its value will be returned if no clause matches. If no default expression is provided and no clause matches, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. Unlike cond and condp, case does a constant-time dispatch, the clauses are not considered sequentially. All manner of constant expressions are acceptable in case, including numbers, strings, symbols, keywords, and (Clojure) composites thereof. Note that since lists are used to group multiple constants that map to the same expression, a vector can be used to match a list if needed. The test-constants need not be all of the same type.
 - [ ] `cast` Throws a ClassCastException if x is not a c, else returns x.
 - [ ] `cat` A transducer which concatenates the contents of each input, which must be a collection, into the reduction.
 - [ ] `catch` The exprs are evaluated and, if no exceptions occur, the value of the last is returned. If an exception occurs and catch clauses are provided, each is examined in turn and the first for which the thrown exception is an instance of the named class is considered a matching catch clause. If there is a matching catch clause, its exprs are evaluated in a context in which name is bound to the thrown exception, and the value of the last is the return value of the function. If there is no matching catch clause, the exception propagates out of the function. Before returning, normally or abnormally, any finally exprs will be evaluated for their side effects. See http://clojure.org/special_forms for more information.
 - [ ] `char` Coerce to char
 - [ ] `char-array` Creates an array of chars

 - [ ] `chunk-buffer` no doc
 - [ ] `chunk-cons` no doc
 - [ ] `chunk-first` no doc
 - [ ] `chunk-next` no doc
 - [ ] `chunk-rest` no doc
 - [ ] `chunked-seq?`  no doc
 - [ ] `class` Returns the Class of x
 - [ ] `class?`  Returns true if x is an instance of Class
 - [ ] `clear-agent-errors` DEPRECATED: Use 'restart-agent' instead. Clears any exceptions thrown during asynchronous actions of the agent, allowing subsequent actions to occur.
 - [ ] `clojure-version` Returns clojure version as a printable string.
 - [ ] `coll?`  Returns true if x implements IPersistentCollection
 - [ ] `comment` Ignores body, yields nil
 - [ ] `commute` Must be called in a transaction. Sets the in-transaction-value of ref to: (apply fun in-transaction-value-of-ref args) and returns the in-transaction-value of ref. At the commit point of the transaction, sets the value of ref to be: (apply fun most-recently-committed-value-of-ref args) Thus fun should be commutative, or, failing that, you must accept last-one-in-wins behavior. commute allows for more concurrency than ref-set.
 - [ ] `comp` Takes a set of functions and returns a fn that is the composition of those fns. The returned fn takes a variable number of args, applies the rightmost of fns to the args, the next fn (right-to-left) to the result, etc.
 - [ ] `comparator` Returns an implementation of java.util.Comparator based upon pred.
 - [ ] `compare` Comparator. Returns a negative number, zero, or a positive number when x is logically 'less than', 'equal to', or 'greater than' y. Same as Java x.compareTo(y) except it also works for nil, and compares numbers and collections in a type-independent manner. x must implement Comparable
 - [ ] `compare-and-set!`  Atomically sets the value of atom to newval if and only if the current value of the atom is identical to oldval. Returns true if set happened, else false
 - [ ] `compile` Compiles the namespace named by the symbol lib into a set of classfiles. The source for the lib must be in a proper classpath-relative directory. The output files will go into the directory specified by *compile-path*, and that directory too must be in the classpath.
 - [ ] `complement` Takes a fn f and returns a fn that takes the same arguments as f, has the same effects, if any, and returns the opposite truth value.
 - [ ] `completing` Takes a reducing function f of 2 args and returns a fn suitable for transduce by adding an arity-1 signature that calls cf (default - identity) on the result argument.
 - [ ] `concat` Returns a lazy seq representing the concatenation of the elements in the supplied colls.
 - [ ] `cond` Takes a set of test/expr pairs. It evaluates each test one at a time. If a test returns logical true, cond evaluates and returns the value of the corresponding expr and doesn't evaluate any of the other tests or exprs. (cond) returns nil.
 - [ ] `cond->` Takes an expression and a set of test/form pairs. Threads expr (via ->) through each form for which the corresponding test expression is true. Note that, unlike cond branching, cond-> threading does not short circuit after the first true test expression.
 - [ ] `cond->>` Takes an expression and a set of test/form pairs. Threads expr (via ->>) through each form for which the corresponding test expression is true. Note that, unlike cond branching, cond->> threading does not short circuit after the first true test expression.
 - [ ] `condp` Takes a binary predicate, an expression, and a set of clauses. Each clause can take the form of either: test-expr result-expr test-expr :>> result-fn Note :>> is an ordinary keyword. For each clause, (pred test-expr expr) is evaluated. If it returns logical true, the clause is a match. If a binary clause matches, the result-expr is returned, if a ternary clause matches, its result-fn, which must be a unary function, is called with the result of the predicate as its argument, the result of that call being the return value of condp. A single default expression can follow the clauses, and its value will be returned if no clause matches. If no default expression is provided and no clause matches, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
 - [ ] `conj` conj[oin]. Returns a new collection with the xs 'added'. (conj nil item) returns (item). (conj coll) returns coll. (conj) returns []. The 'addition' may happen at different 'places' depending on the concrete type.
 - [ ] `conj!`  Adds x to the transient collection, and return coll. The 'addition' may happen at different 'places' depending on the concrete type.
 - [ ] `cons` Returns a new seq where x is the first element and seq is the rest.
 - [ ] `constantly` Returns a function that takes any number of arguments and returns x.
 - [ ] `construct-proxy` Takes a proxy class and any arguments for its superclass ctor and creates and returns an instance of the proxy.
 - [ ] `contains?`  Returns true if key is present in the given collection, otherwise returns false. Note that for numerically indexed collections like vectors and Java arrays, this tests if the numeric key is within the range of indexes. 'contains?' operates constant or logarithmic time; it will not perform a linear search for a value. See also 'some'.
 - [ ] `count` Returns the number of items in the collection. (count nil) returns 0. Also works on strings, arrays, and Java Collections and Maps
 - [ ] `counted?`  Returns true if coll implements count in constant time
 - [ ] `create-ns` Create a new namespace named by the symbol if one doesn't already exist, returns it or the already-existing namespace of the same name.
 - [ ] `create-struct` Returns a structure basis object.
 - [ ] `cycle` Returns a lazy (infinite!) sequence of repetitions of the items in coll.
 - [ ] `dec` Returns a number one less than num. Does not auto-promote longs, will throw on overflow. See also: dec'
 - [ ] `dec'` Returns a number one less than num. Supports arbitrary precision. See also: dec
 - [ ] `decimal?`  Returns true if n is a BigDecimal
 - [ ] `declare` defs the supplied var names with no bindings, useful for making forward declarations.
 - [ ] `dedupe` Returns a lazy sequence removing consecutive duplicates in coll. Returns a transducer when no collection is provided.
 - [ ] `def` Creates and interns or locates a global var with the name of symbol and a namespace of the value of the current namespace (*ns*). See http://clojure.org/special_forms for more information.
 - [ ] `default-data-readers` Default map of data reader functions provided by Clojure. May be overridden by binding *data-readers*.
 - [ ] `definline` Experimental - like defmacro, except defines a named function whose body is the expansion, calls to which may be expanded inline as if it were a macro. Cannot be used with variadic (&) args.
 - [ ] `definterface` Creates a new Java interface with the given name and method sigs. The method return types and parameter types may be specified with type hints, defaulting to Object if omitted. (definterface MyInterface (^int method1 [x]) (^Bar method2 [^Baz b ^Quux q]))
 - [ ] `defmacro` Like defn, but the resulting function name is declared as a macro and will be used as a macro by the compiler when it is called.
 - [ ] `defmethod` Creates and installs a new method of multimethod associated with dispatch-value.
 - [ ] `defmulti` Creates a new multimethod with the associated dispatch function. The docstring and attr-map are optional. Options are key-value pairs and may be one of: :default The default dispatch value, defaults to :default :hierarchy The value used for hierarchical dispatch (e.g. ::square is-a ::shape) Hierarchies are type-like relationships that do not depend upon type inheritance. By default Clojure's multimethods dispatch off of a global hierarchy map. However, a hierarchy relationship can be created with the derive function used to augment the root ancestor created with make-hierarchy. Multimethods expect the value of the hierarchy option to be supplied as a reference type e.g. a var (i.e. via the Var-quote dispatch macro #' or the var special form).
 - [ ] `defn` Same as (def name (fn [params* ] exprs*)) or (def name (fn ([params* ] exprs*)+)) with any doc-string or attrs added to the var metadata. prepost-map defines a map with optional keys :pre and :post that contain collections of pre or post conditions.
 - [ ] `defn-` same as defn, yielding non-public def
 - [ ] `defonce` defs name to have the root value of the expr iff the named var has no root value, else expr is unevaluated
 - [ ] `defprotocol` A protocol is a named set of named methods and their signatures: (defprotocol AProtocolName ;optional doc string "A doc string for AProtocol abstraction" ;options :extend-via-metadata true ;method signatures (bar [this a b] "bar docs") (baz [this a] [this a b] [this a b c] "baz docs")) No implementations are provided. Docs can be specified for the protocol overall and for each method. The above yields a set of polymorphic functions and a protocol object. All are namespace-qualified by the ns enclosing the definition The resulting functions dispatch on the type of their first argument, which is required and corresponds to the implicit target object ('this' in Java parlance). defprotocol is dynamic, has no special compile-time effect, and defines no new types or classes. Implementations of the protocol methods can be provided using extend. When :extend-via-metadata is true, values can extend protocols by adding metadata where keys are fully-qualified protocol function symbols and values are function implementations. Protocol implementations are checked first for direct definitions (defrecord, deftype, reify), then metadata definitions, then external extensions (extend, extend-type, extend-protocol) defprotocol will automatically generate a corresponding interface, with the same name as the protocol, i.e. given a protocol: my.ns/Protocol, an interface: my.ns.Protocol. The interface will have methods corresponding to the protocol functions, and the protocol will automatically work with instances of the interface. Note that you should not use this interface with deftype or reify, as they support the protocol directly: (defprotocol P (foo [this]) (bar-me [this] [this y])) (deftype Foo [a b c] P (foo [this] a) (bar-me [this] b) (bar-me [this y] (+ c y))) (bar-me (Foo. 1 2 3) 42) => 45 (foo (let [x 42] (reify P (foo [this] 17) (bar-me [this] x) (bar-me [this y] x)))) => 17
 - [ ] `defrecord` (defrecord name [fields*] options* specs*) Options are expressed as sequential keywords and arguments (in any order). Supported options: :load-ns - if true, importing the record class will cause the namespace in which the record was defined to be loaded. Defaults to false. Each spec consists of a protocol or interface name followed by zero or more method bodies: protocol-or-interface-or-Object (methodName [args*] body)* Dynamically generates compiled bytecode for class with the given name, in a package with the same name as the current namespace, the given fields, and, optionally, methods for protocols and/or interfaces. The class will have the (immutable) fields named by fields, which can have type hints. Protocols/interfaces and methods are optional. The only methods that can be supplied are those declared in the protocols/interfaces. Note that method bodies are not closures, the local environment includes only the named fields, and those fields can be accessed directly. Method definitions take the form: (methodname [args*] body) The argument and return types can be hinted on the arg and methodname symbols. If not supplied, they will be inferred, so type hints should be reserved for disambiguation. Methods should be supplied for all methods of the desired protocol(s) and interface(s). You can also define overrides for methods of Object. Note that a parameter must be supplied to correspond to the target object ('this' in Java parlance). Thus methods for interfaces will take one more argument than do the interface declarations. Note also that recur calls to the method head should *not* pass the target object, it will be supplied automatically and can not be substituted. In the method bodies, the (unqualified) name can be used to name the class (for calls to new, instance? etc). The class will have implementations of several (clojure.lang) interfaces generated automatically: IObj (metadata support) and IPersistentMap, and all of their superinterfaces. In addition, defrecord will define type-and-value-based =, and will defined Java .hashCode and .equals consistent with the contract for java.util.Map. When AOT compiling, generates compiled bytecode for a class with the given name (a symbol), prepends the current ns as the package, and writes the .class file to the *compile-path* directory. Two constructors will be defined, one taking the designated fields followed by a metadata map (nil for none) and an extension field map (nil for none), and one taking only the fields (using nil for meta and extension fields). Note that the field names __meta, __extmap, __hash and __hasheq are currently reserved and should not be used when defining your own records. Given (defrecord TypeName ...), two factory functions will be defined: ->TypeName, taking positional parameters for the fields, and map->TypeName, taking a map of keywords to field values.
 - [ ] `defstruct` Same as (def name (create-struct keys...))
 - [ ] `deftype` (deftype name [fields*] options* specs*) Options are expressed as sequential keywords and arguments (in any order). Supported options: :load-ns - if true, importing the type class will cause the namespace in which the type was defined to be loaded. Defaults to false. Each spec consists of a protocol or interface name followed by zero or more method bodies: protocol-or-interface-or-Object (methodName [args*] body)* Dynamically generates compiled bytecode for class with the given name, in a package with the same name as the current namespace, the given fields, and, optionally, methods for protocols and/or interfaces. The class will have the (by default, immutable) fields named by fields, which can have type hints. Protocols/interfaces and methods are optional. The only methods that can be supplied are those declared in the protocols/interfaces. Note that method bodies are not closures, the local environment includes only the named fields, and those fields can be accessed directly. Fields can be qualified with the metadata :volatile-mutable true or :unsynchronized-mutable true, at which point (set! afield aval) will be supported in method bodies. Note well that mutable fields are extremely difficult to use correctly, and are present only to facilitate the building of higher level constructs, such as Clojure's reference types, in Clojure itself. They are for experts only - if the semantics and implications of :volatile-mutable or :unsynchronized-mutable are not immediately apparent to you, you should not be using them. Method definitions take the form: (methodname [args*] body) The argument and return types can be hinted on the arg and methodname symbols. If not supplied, they will be inferred, so type hints should be reserved for disambiguation. Methods should be supplied for all methods of the desired protocol(s) and interface(s). You can also define overrides for methods of Object. Note that a parameter must be supplied to correspond to the target object ('this' in Java parlance). Thus methods for interfaces will take one more argument than do the interface declarations. Note also that recur calls to the method head should *not* pass the target object, it will be supplied automatically and can not be substituted. In the method bodies, the (unqualified) name can be used to name the class (for calls to new, instance? etc). When AOT compiling, generates compiled bytecode for a class with the given name (a symbol), prepends the current ns as the package, and writes the .class file to the *compile-path* directory. One constructor will be defined, taking the designated fields. Note that the field names __meta, __extmap, __hash and __hasheq are currently reserved and should not be used when defining your own types. Given (deftype TypeName ...), a factory function called ->TypeName will be defined, taking positional parameters for the fields
 - [ ] `delay` Takes a body of expressions and yields a Delay object that will invoke the body only the first time it is forced (with force or deref/@), and will cache the result and return it on all subsequent force calls. See also - realized?
 - [ ] `delay?`  returns true if x is a Delay created with delay
 - [ ] `deliver` Delivers the supplied value to the promise, releasing any pending derefs. A subsequent call to deliver on a promise will have no effect.
 - [ ] `denominator` Returns the denominator part of a Ratio.
 - [ ] `deref` Also reader macro: @ref/@agent/@var/@atom/@delay/@future/@promise. Within a transaction, returns the in-transaction-value of ref, else returns the most-recently-committed value of ref. When applied to a var, agent or atom, returns its current state. When applied to a delay, forces it if not already forced. When applied to a future, will block if computation not complete. When applied to a promise, will block until a value is delivered. The variant taking a timeout can be used for blocking references (futures and promises), and will return timeout-val if the timeout (in milliseconds) is reached before a value is available. See also - realized?.
 - [ ] `derive` Establishes a parent/child relationship between parent and tag. Parent must be a namespace-qualified symbol or keyword and child can be either a namespace-qualified symbol or keyword or a class. h must be a hierarchy obtained from make-hierarchy, if not supplied defaults to, and modifies, the global hierarchy.
 - [ ] `descendants` Returns the immediate and indirect children of tag, through a relationship established via derive. h must be a hierarchy obtained from make-hierarchy, if not supplied defaults to the global hierarchy. Note: does not work on Java type inheritance relationships.

 - [ ] `do` Evaluates the expressions in order and returns the value of the last. If no expressions are supplied, returns nil. See http://clojure.org/special_forms for more information.
 - [ ] `doall` When lazy sequences are produced via functions that have side effects, any effects other than those needed to produce the first element in the seq do not occur until the seq is consumed. doall can be used to force any effects. Walks through the successive nexts of the seq, retains the head and returns it, thus causing the entire seq to reside in memory at one time.
 - [ ] `dorun` When lazy sequences are produced via functions that have side effects, any effects other than those needed to produce the first element in the seq do not occur until the seq is consumed. dorun can be used to force any effects. Walks through the successive nexts of the seq, does not retain the head and returns nil.
 - [ ] `doseq` Repeatedly executes body (presumably for side-effects) with bindings and filtering as provided by "for". Does not retain the head of the sequence. Returns nil.
 - [ ] `dosync` Runs the exprs (in an implicit do) in a transaction that encompasses exprs and any nested calls. Starts a transaction if none is already running on this thread. Any uncaught exception will abort the transaction and flow out of dosync. The exprs may be run more than once, but any effects on Refs will be atomic.
 - [ ] `dotimes` bindings => name n Repeatedly executes body (presumably for side-effects) with name bound to integers from 0 through n-1.
 - [ ] `doto` Evaluates x then calls all of the methods and functions with the value of x supplied at the front of the given arguments. The forms are evaluated in order. Returns x. (doto (new java.util.HashMap) (.put "a" 1) (.put "b" 2))

 - [ ] `eduction` Returns a reducible/iterable application of the transducers to the items in coll. Transducers are applied in order as if combined with comp. Note that these applications will be performed every time reduce/iterator is called.
 - [ ] `empty` Returns an empty collection of the same category as coll, or nil
 - [ ] `EMPTY-NODE` no doc
 - [ ] `empty?`  Returns true if coll has no items - same as (not (seq coll)). Please use the idiom (seq x) rather than (not (empty? x))
 - [ ] `ensure` Must be called in a transaction. Protects the ref from modification by other transactions. Returns the in-transaction-value of ref. Allows for more concurrency than (ref-set ref @ref)
 - [ ] `ensure-reduced` If x is already reduced?, returns it, else returns (reduced x)
 - [ ] `enumeration-seq` Returns a seq on a java.util.Enumeration
 - [ ] `error-handler` Returns the error-handler of agent a, or nil if there is none. See set-error-handler!
 - [ ] `error-mode` Returns the error-mode of agent a. See set-error-mode!
 - [ ] `eval` Evaluates the form data structure (not text!) and returns the result.
 - [ ] `even?`  Returns true if n is even, throws an exception if n is not an integer
 - [ ] `every-pred` Takes a set of predicates and returns a function f that returns true if all of its composing predicates return a logical true value against all of its arguments, else it returns false. Note that f is short-circuiting in that it will stop execution on the first argument that triggers a logical false result against the original predicates.
 - [ ] `every?`  Returns true if (pred x) is logical true for every x in coll, else false.
 - [ ] `ex-cause` Returns the cause of ex if ex is a Throwable. Otherwise returns nil.

 - [ ] `ex-info` Create an instance of ExceptionInfo, a RuntimeException subclass that carries a map of additional data.
 - [ ] `ex-message` Returns the message attached to ex if ex is a Throwable. Otherwise returns nil.
 - [ ] `extend` Implementations of protocol methods can be provided using the extend construct: (extend AType AProtocol {:foo an-existing-fn :bar (fn [a b] ...) :baz (fn ([a]...) ([a b] ...)...)} BProtocol {...} ...) extend takes a type/class (or interface, see below), and one or more protocol + method map pairs. It will extend the polymorphism of the protocol's methods to call the supplied methods when an AType is provided as the first argument. Method maps are maps of the keyword-ized method names to ordinary fns. This facilitates easy reuse of existing fns and fn maps, for code reuse/mixins without derivation or composition. You can extend an interface to a protocol. This is primarily to facilitate interop with the host (e.g. Java) but opens the door to incidental multiple inheritance of implementation since a class can inherit from more than one interface, both of which extend the protocol. It is TBD how to specify which impl to use. You can extend a protocol on nil. If you are supplying the definitions explicitly (i.e. not reusing exsting functions or mixin maps), you may find it more convenient to use the extend-type or extend-protocol macros. Note that multiple independent extend clauses can exist for the same type, not all protocols need be defined in a single extend call. See also: extends?, satisfies?, extenders
 - [ ] `extend-protocol` Useful when you want to provide several implementations of the same protocol all at once. Takes a single protocol and the implementation of that protocol for one or more types. Expands into calls to extend-type: (extend-protocol Protocol AType (foo [x] ...) (bar [x y] ...) BType (foo [x] ...) (bar [x y] ...) AClass (foo [x] ...) (bar [x y] ...) nil (foo [x] ...) (bar [x y] ...)) expands into: (do (clojure.core/extend-type AType Protocol (foo [x] ...) (bar [x y] ...)) (clojure.core/extend-type BType Protocol (foo [x] ...) (bar [x y] ...)) (clojure.core/extend-type AClass Protocol (foo [x] ...) (bar [x y] ...)) (clojure.core/extend-type nil Protocol (foo [x] ...) (bar [x y] ...)))
 - [ ] `extend-type` A macro that expands into an extend call. Useful when you are supplying the definitions explicitly inline, extend-type automatically creates the maps required by extend. Propagates the class as a type hint on the first argument of all fns. (extend-type MyType Countable (cnt [c] ...) Foo (bar [x y] ...) (baz ([x] ...) ([x y & zs] ...))) expands into: (extend MyType Countable {:cnt (fn [c] ...)} Foo {:baz (fn ([x] ...) ([x y & zs] ...)) :bar (fn [x y] ...)})
 - [ ] `extenders` Returns a collection of the types explicitly extending protocol
 - [ ] `extends?`  Returns true if atype extends protocol
 - [ ] `false?`  Returns true if x is the value false, false otherwise.
 - [ ] `ffirst` Same as (first (first x))
 - [ ] `file-seq` A tree seq on java.io.Files
 - [ ] `filter` Returns a lazy sequence of the items in coll for which (pred item) returns logical true. pred must be free of side-effects. Returns a transducer when no collection is provided.
 - [ ] `filterv` Returns a vector of the items in coll for which (pred item) returns logical true. pred must be free of side-effects.
 - [ ] `finally` The exprs are evaluated and, if no exceptions occur, the value of the last is returned. If an exception occurs and catch clauses are provided, each is examined in turn and the first for which the thrown exception is an instance of the named class is considered a matching catch clause. If there is a matching catch clause, its exprs are evaluated in a context in which name is bound to the thrown exception, and the value of the last is the return value of the function. If there is no matching catch clause, the exception propagates out of the function. Before returning, normally or abnormally, any finally exprs will be evaluated for their side effects. See http://clojure.org/special_forms for more information.
 - [ ] `find` Returns the map entry for key, or nil if key not present.
 - [ ] `find-keyword` Returns a Keyword with the given namespace and name if one already exists. This function will not intern a new keyword. If the keyword has not already been interned, it will return nil. Do not use : in the keyword strings, it will be added automatically.
 - [ ] `find-ns` Returns the namespace named by the symbol or nil if it doesn't exist.
 - [ ] `find-protocol-impl` no doc
 - [ ] `find-protocol-method` no doc
 - [ ] `find-var` Returns the global var named by the namespace-qualified symbol, or nil if no var with that name.
 - [ ] `first` Returns the first item in the collection. Calls seq on its argument. If coll is nil, returns nil.
 - [ ] `flatten` Takes any nested combination of sequential things (lists, vectors, etc.) and returns their contents as a single, flat lazy sequence. (flatten nil) returns an empty sequence.
 - [ ] `float` Coerce to float
 - [ ] `float-array` Creates an array of floats
 - [ ] `float?`  Returns true if n is a floating point number
 - [ ] `floats` Casts to float[]
 - [ ] `flush` Flushes the output stream that is the current value of *out*
 - [ ] `fn` params => positional-params*, or positional-params* & rest-param positional-param => binding-form rest-param => binding-form binding-form => name, or destructuring-form Defines a function. See https://clojure.org/reference/special_forms#fn for more information
 - [ ] `fn?`  Returns true if x implements Fn, i.e. is an object created via fn.
 - [ ] `fnext` Same as (first (next x))
 - [ ] `fnil` Takes a function f, and returns a function that calls f, replacing a nil first argument to f with the supplied value x. Higher arity versions can replace arguments in the second and third positions (y, z). Note that the function f can take any number of arguments, not just the one(s) being nil-patched.
 - [ ] `for` List comprehension. Takes a vector of one or more binding-form/collection-expr pairs, each followed by zero or more modifiers, and yields a lazy sequence of evaluations of expr. Collections are iterated in a nested fashion, rightmost fastest, and nested coll-exprs can refer to bindings created in prior binding-forms. Supported modifiers are: :let [binding-form expr ...], :while test, :when test. (take 100 (for [x (range 100000000) y (range 1000000) :while (< y x)] [x y]))
 - [ ] `force` If x is a Delay, returns the (possibly cached) value of its expression, else returns x
 - [ ] `format` Formats a string using java.lang.String.format, see java.util.Formatter for format string syntax
 - [ ] `frequencies` Returns a map from distinct items in coll to the number of times they appear.
 - [ ] `future` Takes a body of expressions and yields a future object that will invoke the body in another thread, and will cache the result and return it on all subsequent calls to deref/@. If the computation has not yet finished, calls to deref/@ will block, unless the variant of deref with timeout is used. See also - realized?.
 - [ ] `future-call` Takes a function of no args and yields a future object that will invoke the function in another thread, and will cache the result and return it on all subsequent calls to deref/@. If the computation has not yet finished, calls to deref/@ will block, unless the variant of deref with timeout is used. See also - realized?.
 - [ ] `future-cancel` Cancels the future, if possible.
 - [ ] `future-cancelled?`  Returns true if future f is cancelled
 - [ ] `future-done?`  Returns true if future f is done
 - [ ] `future?`  Returns true if x is a future
 - [ ] `gen-class` When compiling, generates compiled bytecode for a class with the given package-qualified :name (which, as all names in these parameters, can be a string or symbol), and writes the .class file to the *compile-path* directory. When not compiling, does nothing. The gen-class construct contains no implementation, as the implementation will be dynamically sought by the generated class in functions in an implementing Clojure namespace. Given a generated class org.mydomain.MyClass with a method named mymethod, gen-class will generate an implementation that looks for a function named by (str prefix mymethod) (default prefix: "-") in a Clojure namespace specified by :impl-ns (defaults to the current namespace). All inherited methods, generated methods, and init and main functions (see :methods, :init, and :main below) will be found similarly prefixed. By default, the static initializer for the generated class will attempt to load the Clojure support code for the class as a resource from the classpath, e.g. in the example case, ``org/mydomain/MyClass__init.class``. This behavior can be controlled by :load-impl-ns Note that methods with a maximum of 18 parameters are supported. In all subsequent sections taking types, the primitive types can be referred to by their Java names (int, float etc), and classes in the java.lang package can be used without a package qualifier. All other classes must be fully qualified. Options should be a set of key/value pairs, all except for :name are optional: :name aname The package-qualified name of the class to be generated :extends aclass Specifies the superclass, the non-private methods of which will be overridden by the class. If not provided, defaults to Object. :implements [interface ...] One or more interfaces, the methods of which will be implemented by the class. :init name If supplied, names a function that will be called with the arguments to the constructor. Must return [ [superclass-constructor-args] state] If not supplied, the constructor args are passed directly to the superclass constructor and the state will be nil :constructors {[param-types] [super-param-types], ...} By default, constructors are created for the generated class which match the signature(s) of the constructors for the superclass. This parameter may be used to explicitly specify constructors, each entry providing a mapping from a constructor signature to a superclass constructor signature. When you supply this, you must supply an :init specifier. :post-init name If supplied, names a function that will be called with the object as the first argument, followed by the arguments to the constructor. It will be called every time an object of this class is created, immediately after all the inherited constructors have completed. Its return value is ignored. :methods [ [name [param-types] return-type], ...] The generated class automatically defines all of the non-private methods of its superclasses/interfaces. This parameter can be used to specify the signatures of additional methods of the generated class. Static methods can be specified with ^{:static true} in the signature's metadata. Do not repeat superclass/interface signatures here. :main boolean If supplied and true, a static public main function will be generated. It will pass each string of the String[] argument as a separate argument to a function called (str prefix main). :factory name If supplied, a (set of) public static factory function(s) will be created with the given name, and the same signature(s) as the constructor(s). :state name If supplied, a public final instance field with the given name will be created. You must supply an :init function in order to provide a value for the state. Note that, though final, the state can be a ref or agent, supporting the creation of Java objects with transactional or asynchronous mutation semantics. :exposes {protected-field-name {:get name :set name}, ...} Since the implementations of the methods of the generated class occur in Clojure functions, they have no access to the inherited protected fields of the superclass. This parameter can be used to generate public getter/setter methods exposing the protected field(s) for use in the implementation. :exposes-methods {super-method-name exposed-name, ...} It is sometimes necessary to call the superclass' implementation of an overridden method. Those methods may be exposed and referred in the new method implementation by a local name. :prefix string Default: "-" Methods called e.g. Foo will be looked up in vars called prefixFoo in the implementing ns. :impl-ns name Default: the name of the current ns. Implementations of methods will be looked up in this namespace. :load-impl-ns boolean Default: true. Causes the static initializer for the generated class to reference the load code for the implementing namespace. Should be true when implementing-ns is the default, false if you intend to load the code via some other method.
 - [ ] `gen-interface` When compiling, generates compiled bytecode for an interface with the given package-qualified :name (which, as all names in these parameters, can be a string or symbol), and writes the .class file to the *compile-path* directory. When not compiling, does nothing. In all subsequent sections taking types, the primitive types can be referred to by their Java names (int, float etc), and classes in the java.lang package can be used without a package qualifier. All other classes must be fully qualified. Options should be a set of key/value pairs, all except for :name are optional: :name aname The package-qualified name of the class to be generated :extends [interface ...] One or more interfaces, which will be extended by this interface. :methods [ [name [param-types] return-type], ...] This parameter is used to specify the signatures of the methods of the generated interface. Do not repeat superinterface signatures here.
 - [ ] `gensym` Returns a new symbol with a unique name. If a prefix string is supplied, the name is prefix# where # is some unique number. If prefix is not supplied, the prefix is 'G__'.
 - [ ] `get` Returns the value mapped to key, not-found or nil if key not present in associative collection, set, string, array, or ILookup instance.
 - [ ] `get-in` Returns the value in a nested associative structure, where ks is a sequence of keys. Returns nil if the key is not present, or the not-found value if supplied.
 - [ ] `get-method` Given a multimethod and a dispatch value, returns the dispatch fn that would apply to that value, or nil if none apply and no default
 - [ ] `get-proxy-class` Takes an optional single class followed by zero or more interfaces. If not supplied class defaults to Object. Creates an returns an instance of a proxy class derived from the supplied classes. The resulting value is cached and used for any subsequent requests for the same class set. Returns a Class object.
 - [ ] `get-thread-bindings` Get a map with the Var/value pairs which is currently in effect for the current thread.
 - [ ] `get-validator` Gets the validator-fn for a var/ref/agent/atom.
 - [ ] `group-by` Returns a map of the elements of coll keyed by the result of f on each element. The value at each key will be a vector of the corresponding elements, in the order they appeared in coll.
 - [ ] `halt-when` Returns a transducer that ends transduction when pred returns true for an input. When retf is supplied it must be a fn of 2 arguments - it will be passed the (completed) result so far and the input that triggered the predicate, and its return value (if it does not throw an exception) will be the return value of the transducer. If retf is not supplied, the input that triggered the predicate will be returned. If the predicate never returns true the transduction is unaffected.
 - [ ] `hash` Returns the hash code of its argument. Note this is the hash code consistent with =, and thus is different than .hashCode for Integer, Short, Byte and Clojure collections.
 - [ ] `hash-combine` no doc
 - [ ] `hash-map` keyval => key val Returns a new hash map with supplied mappings. If any keys are equal, they are handled as if by repeated uses of assoc.

 - [ ] `hash-set` Returns a new hash set with supplied keys. Any equal keys are handled as if by repeated uses of conj.
 - [ ] `hash-unordered-coll` Returns the hash code, consistent with =, for an external unordered collection implementing Iterable. For maps, the iterator should return map entries whose hash is computed as (hash-ordered-coll [k v]). See http://clojure.org/data_structures#hash for full algorithms.

 - [ ] `if-some` bindings => binding-form test If test is not nil, evaluates then with binding-form bound to the value of test, if not, yields else
 - [ ] `ifn?`  Returns true if x implements IFn. Note that many data structures (e.g. sets and maps) implement IFn
 - [ ] `import` import-list => (package-symbol class-name-symbols*) For each name in class-name-symbols, adds a mapping from name to the class named by package.name to the current namespace. Use :import in the ns macro in preference to calling this directly.
 - [ ] `in-ns` Sets *ns* to the namespace named by the symbol, creating it if needed.

If val is not supplied, returns the result of applying f to the first 2 items in coll, then applying f to that result and the 3rd item, etc. If coll contains no items, f must accept no arguments as well, and reduce returns the result of calling f with no arguments. If coll has only 1 item, it is returned and f is not called. If val is supplied, returns the result of applying f to val and the first item in coll, then applying f to that result and the 2nd item, etc. If coll contains no items, returns val and f is not called.

If the new state is unacceptable, the validate-fn should return false or throw an exception. validate-fn will be called on transaction commit, when all refs have their final values. Normally refs accumulate history dynamically as needed to deal with read demands. If you know in advance you will need history you can set :min-history to ensure it will be available when first needed (instead of after a read fault). History is limited, and the limit can be set with :max-history.

 - [ ] `ref-max-history` Gets the max-history of a ref, or sets it and returns the ref
 - [ ] `ref-min-history` Gets the min-history of a ref, or sets it and returns the ref

 - [ ] `refer` refers to all public vars of ns, subject to filters. filters can include at most one each of: :exclude list-of-symbols :only list-of-symbols :rename map-of-fromsymbol-tosymbol For each public interned var in the namespace named by the symbol, adds a mapping from the name of the var to the var to the current namespace. Throws an exception if name is already mapped to something else in the current namespace. Filters can be used to select a subset, via inclusion or exclusion, or to provide a mapping to a symbol different from the var's name, in order to prevent clashes. Use :use in the ns macro in preference to calling this directly.
 - [ ] `refer-clojure` Same as (refer 'clojure.core )
 - [ ] `reify` reify creates an object implementing a protocol or interface. reify is a macro with the following structure: (reify options* specs*) Currently there are no options. Each spec consists of the protocol or interface name followed by zero or more method bodies: protocol-or-interface-or-Object (methodName [args+] body)* Methods should be supplied for all methods of the desired protocol(s) and interface(s). You can also define overrides for methods of Object. Note that the first parameter must be supplied to correspond to the target object ('this' in Java parlance). Thus methods for interfaces will take one more argument than do the interface declarations. Note also that recur calls to the method head should *not* pass the target object, it will be supplied automatically and can not be substituted. The return type can be indicated by a type hint on the method name, and arg types can be indicated by a type hint on arg names. If you leave out all hints, reify will try to match on same name/arity method in the protocol(s)/interface(s) - this is preferred. If you supply any hints at all, no inference is done, so all hints (or default of Object) must be correct, for both arguments and return type. If a method is overloaded in a protocol/interface, multiple independent method definitions must be supplied. If overloaded with same arity in an interface you must specify complete hints to disambiguate - a missing hint implies Object. recur works to method heads The method bodies of reify are lexical closures, and can refer to the surrounding local scope: (str (let [f "foo"] (reify Object (toString [this] f)))) == "foo" (seq (let [f "foo"] (reify clojure.lang.Seqable (seq [this] (seq f))))) == (\f \o \o)) reify always implements clojure.lang.IObj and transfers meta data of the form to the created object. (meta ^{:k :v} (reify Object (toString [this] "foo"))) == {:k :v}
 - [ ] `release-pending-sends` Normally, actions sent directly or indirectly during another action are held until the action completes (changes the agent's state). This function can be used to dispatch any pending sent actions immediately. This has no impact on actions sent during a transaction, which are still held until commit. If no action is occurring, does nothing. Returns the number of actions dispatched.
 - [ ] `rem` remainder of dividing numerator by denominator.
 - [ ] `remove` Returns a lazy sequence of the items in coll for which (pred item) returns logical false. pred must be free of side-effects. Returns a transducer when no collection is provided.
 - [ ] `remove-all-methods` Removes all of the methods of multimethod.
 - [ ] `remove-method` Removes the method of multimethod associated with dispatch-value.
 - [ ] `remove-ns` Removes the namespace named by the symbol. Use with caution. Cannot be used to remove the clojure namespace.
 - [ ] `remove-tap` Remove f from the tap set.
 - [ ] `remove-watch` Removes a watch (set by add-watch) from a reference
 - [ ] `repeat` Returns a lazy (infinite!, or length n if supplied) sequence of xs.
 - [ ] `repeatedly` Takes a function of no args, presumably with side effects, and returns an infinite (or length n if supplied) lazy sequence of calls to it
 - [ ] `replace` Given a map of replacement pairs and a vector/collection, returns a vector/seq with any elements = a key in smap replaced with the corresponding val in smap. Returns a transducer when no collection is provided.
 - [ ] `replicate` DEPRECATED: Use 'repeat' instead. Returns a lazy seq of n xs.
 - [ ] `require` Loads libs, skipping any that are already loaded. Each argument is either a libspec that identifies a lib, a prefix list that identifies multiple libs whose names share a common prefix, or a flag that modifies how all the identified libs are loaded. Use :require in the ns macro in preference to calling this directly. Libs A 'lib' is a named set of resources in classpath whose contents define a library of Clojure code. Lib names are symbols and each lib is associated with a Clojure namespace and a Java package that share its name. A lib's name also locates its root directory within classpath using Java's package name to classpath-relative path mapping. All resources in a lib should be contained in the directory structure under its root directory. All definitions a lib makes should be in its associated namespace. 'require loads a lib by loading its root resource. The root resource path is derived from the lib name in the following manner: Consider a lib named by the symbol 'x.y.z; it has the root directory /x/y/, and its root resource is /x/y/z.clj, or /x/y/z.cljc if /x/y/z.clj does not exist. The root resource should contain code to create the lib's namespace (usually by using the ns macro) and load any additional lib resources. Libspecs A libspec is a lib name or a vector containing a lib name followed by options expressed as sequential keywords and arguments. Recognized options: :as takes a symbol as its argument and makes that symbol an alias to the lib's namespace in the current namespace. :as-alias takes a symbol as its argument and aliases like :as, however the lib will not be loaded. If the lib has not been loaded, a new empty namespace will be created (as with create-ns). :refer takes a list of symbols to refer from the namespace or the :all keyword to bring in all public vars. Prefix Lists It's common for Clojure code to depend on several libs whose names have the same prefix. When specifying libs, prefix lists can be used to reduce repetition. A prefix list contains the shared prefix followed by libspecs with the shared prefix removed from the lib names. After removing the prefix, the names that remain must not contain any periods. Flags A flag is a keyword. Recognized flags: :reload, :reload-all, :verbose :reload forces loading of all the identified libs even if they are already loaded (has no effect on libspecs using :as-alias) :reload-all implies :reload and also forces loading of all libs that the identified libs directly or indirectly load via require or use (has no effect on libspecs using :as-alias) :verbose triggers printing information about each load, alias, and refer Example: The following would load the libraries clojure.zip and clojure.set abbreviated as 's'. (require '(clojure zip [set :as s]))
 - [ ] `requiring-resolve` Resolves namespace-qualified sym per 'resolve'. If initial resolve fails, attempts to require sym's namespace and retries.

 - [ ] `rest` Returns a possibly empty seq of the items after the first. Calls seq on its argument.
 - [ ] `restart-agent` When an agent is failed, changes the agent state to new-state and then un-fails the agent so that sends are allowed again. If a :clear-actions true option is given, any actions queued on the agent that were being held while it was failed will be discarded, otherwise those held actions will proceed. The new-state must pass the validator if any, or restart will throw an exception and the agent will remain failed with its old state and error. Watchers, if any, will NOT be notified of the new state. Throws an exception if the agent is not failed.

 - [ ] `send-via` Dispatch an action to an agent. Returns the agent immediately. Subsequently, in a thread supplied by executor, the state of the agent will be set to the value of: (apply action-fn state-of-agent args)
 - [ ] `seq` Returns a seq on the collection. If the collection is empty, returns nil. (seq nil) returns nil. seq also works on Strings, native Java arrays (of reference types) and any objects that implement Iterable. Note that seqs cache values, thus seq should not be used on any Iterable whose iterator repeatedly returns the same mutable object.
 - [ ] `seq-to-map-for-destructuring` Builds a map from a seq as described in https://clojure.org/reference/special_forms#keyword-arguments
 - [ ] `seq?`  Return true if x implements ISeq
 - [ ] `seqable?`  Return true if the seq function is supported for x
 - [ ] `seque` Creates a queued seq on another (presumably lazy) seq s. The queued seq will produce a concrete seq in the background, and can get up to n items ahead of the consumer. n-or-q can be an integer n buffer size, or an instance of java.util.concurrent BlockingQueue. Note that reading from a seque can block if the reader gets ahead of the producer.
 - [ ] `sequence` Coerces coll to a (possibly empty) sequence, if it is not already one. Will not force a lazy seq. (sequence nil) yields (), When a transducer is supplied, returns a lazy sequence of applications of the transform to the items in coll(s), i.e. to the set of first items of each coll, followed by the set of second items in each coll, until any one of the colls is exhausted. Any remaining items in other colls are ignored. The transform should accept number-of-colls arguments
 - [ ] `sequential?`  Returns true if coll implements Sequential
 - [ ] `set` Returns a set of the distinct elements of coll.
 - [ ] `set!`  Assignment special form. When the first operand is a field member access form, the assignment is to the corresponding field. If it is an instance field, the instance expr will be evaluated, then the expr. In all cases the value of expr is returned. Note - you cannot assign to function params or local bindings. Only Java fields, Vars, Refs and Agents are mutable in Clojure. See http://clojure.org/special_forms for more information.
 - [ ] `set-agent-send-executor!`  Sets the ExecutorService to be used by send
 - [ ] `set-agent-send-off-executor!`  Sets the ExecutorService to be used by send-off
 - [ ] `set-error-handler!`  Sets the error-handler of agent a to handler-fn. If an action being run by the agent throws an exception or doesn't pass the validator fn, handler-fn will be called with two arguments: the agent and the exception.
 - [ ] `set-error-mode!`  Sets the error-mode of agent a to mode-keyword, which must be either :fail or :continue. If an action being run by the agent throws an exception or doesn't pass the validator fn, an error-handler may be called (see set-error-handler!), after which, if the mode is :continue, the agent will continue as if neither the action that caused the error nor the error itself ever happened. If the mode is :fail, the agent will become failed and will stop accepting new 'send' and 'send-off' actions, and any previously queued actions will be held until a 'restart-agent'. Deref will still work, returning the state of the agent before the error.
 - [ ] `set-validator!`  Sets the validator-fn for a var/ref/agent/atom. validator-fn must be nil or a side-effect-free fn of one argument, which will be passed the intended new state on any state change. If the new state is unacceptable, the validator-fn should return false or throw an exception. If the current state (root value if var) is not acceptable to the new validator, an exception will be thrown and the validator will not be changed.

 - [ ] `some-fn` Takes a set of predicates and returns a function f that returns the first logical true value returned by one of its composing predicates against any of its arguments, else it returns logical false. Note that f is short-circuiting in that it will stop execution on the first argument that triggers a logical true result against the original predicates.
 - [ ] `some?`  Returns true if x is not nil, false otherwise.
 - [ ] `sort` Returns a sorted sequence of the items in coll. If no comparator is supplied, uses compare. comparator must implement java.util.Comparator. Guaranteed to be stable: equal elements will not be reordered. If coll is a Java array, it will be modified. To avoid this, sort a copy of the array.
 - [ ] `sort-by` Returns a sorted sequence of the items in coll, where the sort order is determined by comparing (keyfn item). If no comparator is supplied, uses compare. comparator must implement java.util.Comparator. Guaranteed to be stable: equal elements will not be reordered. If coll is a Java array, it will be modified. To avoid this, sort a copy of the array.

 - [ ] `subvec` Returns a persistent vector of the items in vector from start (inclusive) to end (exclusive). If end is not supplied, defaults to (count vector). This operation is O(1) and very fast, as the resulting vector shares structure with the original and no trimming is done.
 - [ ] `supers` Returns the immediate and indirect superclasses and interfaces of c, if any
 - [ ] `swap!`  Atomically swaps the value of atom to be: (apply f current-value-of-atom args). Note that f may be called multiple times, and thus should be free of side effects. Returns the value that was swapped in.

 - [ ] `trampoline` trampoline can be used to convert algorithms requiring mutual recursion without stack consumption. Calls f with supplied args, if any. If f returns a fn, calls that fn with no arguments, and continues to repeat, until the return value is not a fn, then returns that non-fn value. Note that if you want to return a fn as a final value, you must wrap it in some data structure and unpack it after trampoline returns.
 - [ ] `transduce` reduce with a transformation of f (xf). If init is not supplied, (f) will be called to produce it. f should be a reducing step function that accepts both 1 and 2 arguments, if it accepts only 2 you can add the arity-1 with 'completing'. Returns the result of applying (the transformed) xf to init and the first item in coll, then applying xf to that result and the 2nd item, etc. If coll contains no items, returns init and f is not called. Note that certain transforms may inject or skip items.
 - [ ] `transient` Returns a new, transient version of the collection, in constant time.
 - [ ] `tree-seq` Returns a lazy sequence of the nodes in a tree, via a depth-first walk. branch? must be a fn of one arg that returns true if passed a node that can have children (but may not). children must be a fn of one arg that returns a sequence of the children. Will only be called on nodes for which branch? returns true. Root is the root node of the tree.
 - [ ] `true?`  Returns true if x is the value true, false otherwise.
 - [ ] `try` The exprs are evaluated and, if no exceptions occur, the value of the last is returned. If an exception occurs and catch clauses are provided, each is examined in turn and the first for which the thrown exception is an instance of the named class is considered a matching catch clause. If there is a matching catch clause, its exprs are evaluated in a context in which name is bound to the thrown exception, and the value of the last is the return value of the function. If there is no matching catch clause, the exception propagates out of the function. Before returning, normally or abnormally, any finally exprs will be evaluated for their side effects. See http://clojure.org/special_forms for more information.

 - [ ] `with-redefs` binding => var-symbol temp-value-expr Temporarily redefines Vars while executing the body. The temp-value-exprs will be evaluated and each resulting value will replace in parallel the root value of its Var. After the body is executed, the root values of all the Vars will be set back to their old values. These temporary changes will be visible in all threads. Useful for mocking out functions during testing.
 - [ ] `with-redefs-fn` Temporarily redefines Vars during a call to func. Each val of binding-map will replace the root value of its key which must be a Var. After func is called with no args, the root values of all the Vars will be set back to their old values. These temporary changes will be visible in all threads. Useful for mocking out functions during testing.
